# HealthOS

**Your body's data in one place: what you eat, take and train, what your wearable measures, and
what it all does to you.**

Started 29 Sept 2026. Owner: Arnold. Answers behind this: the "HealthOS — Discovery Questions" doc.

---

## 1. Why

Understand your own body, see a lot of data about it, push limits, and find out what AI can do
with it. Goals right now: good sleep, good mental health, muscle. Long-term trends matter more
than today. For you only; not a product.

**What kills it:** engines and equations that don't work. It should be feature-rich but not buggy,
and not look "AI-made".

## 2. Soft rules (carried over from Tempo — any can be broken, ask first)

1. **Usable at every step.** Never leave it broken between sessions.
2. **One phase at a time**, used for real before the next. Owner approves each phase.
3. **The engine is pure and tested.** Every calculation (caffeine curve, averages, progression,
   correlations) lives in `/lib` as pure functions with real tests. None inside components.
4. **Verify through the call site, not just the pure function.**
5. **Claim before you build** — mark an item claimed in this doc and push that first.
6. **No shaming, no scaring, no streaks.** Health numbers are facts, shown plainly.
7. **This doc stays dense.** Delete finished items; not a changelog.
8. **Mock whole screens before writing design rules.** Prototypes in `prototypes/`.

## 3. v1 — what ships first

Food, supplements and intake, gym workouts. A place for the wearable, not connected yet (no
device yet — plan is a Fitbit-type band). Tempo link and AI come later. Starting fresh, no import.

### Food
- Calories mainly; protein/carbs/fat shown but not the focus. No targets yet.
- Log from a big food database (Open Food Facts first) + everything you add once is saved and
  offered again. Saved meals. Recipes maybe later. AI "2 eggs, toast" parsing later.
- Log at the time or catch up later. Meal times matter.
- Eating out: log kcal or an estimate.
- **A day clearly not logged is excluded from averages** — a 0 kcal day must not skew anything.
- Not repetitive eater, so search speed matters more than "repeat yesterday".

### Intake (the heart of the app)
- Current stack: creatine, magnesium 400 mg (night), vitamin D, coffee ×2, saffron 30 mg, black
  cumin seed oil.
- **Caffeine-in-body curve** (half-life ~5h), drawn on the same chart as wearable data later
  (e.g. heart rate vs coffee). Same for alcohol and other supplements where the stats exist.
- Drinks come from a database (one Red Bull, one espresso); own values allowed. A few mg off is fine.
- Daily stack: set once (e.g. 400 mg magnesium at night); at end of day tick ✓ or ✗. Tap to log,
  or custom amount.
- Cycling / on-off experiments: yes. Rate the effect afterwards: yes.
- Alcohol and nicotine: yes. Interaction/timing warnings: YES.
- AI later researches side effects and watches for them.
- No stock tracking. No blood tests for now.

### Workouts and body
- Gym 3×/week, own split. Log every set (weight × reps) during the workout.
- Suggest next weight/reps. Cardio imported from the wearable later.
- "Improving" = all of it: 1RM estimates, volume, and more — see data plus insights.
- Weight daily. Personal records: noted, not celebrated.

### Feelings
- Energy, mood, focus, anxiety, stress. Slider plus a word. Symptoms: yes. Notes: **yes** (how I
  felt at the gym, after a supplement, after a task). How often: not decided.

## 4. Later

- **Wearable:** iPhone + a Fitbit-type band. All metrics. Automatic, as live as possible. Raw
  data vs summaries decided when we see what the API gives. Smart scale later. Nights without
  data are skipped.
- **Tempo link:** decide later. Separate Supabase project, same account.
- **Insights:** preset views only at first; show values against targets; a report screen; mark
  events on graphs (started creatine, sick…); export: yes. Needs: a day view graph, readiness,
  sleep. The "5 questions the graphs answer" are still open — propose them in prototypes.
- **AI:** does everything eventually — summaries, correlations, experiments ("magnesium 3 weeks
  on/off"), predictions (sleep score, weight, health). Confidence as a %. Speaks up on its own,
  gentle suggestions. Sending data to an AI API is OK. Budget ~€20/month.

## 5. Design

- **Web app** (installable to the home screen), not native — Fitbit's data comes through its own
  web API, so native isn't needed. Revisit only for an Apple Watch or lock-screen widgets.
- Log on the phone, insights on the laptop. Dark for now.
- Lots of data, raw data too, **plus a calm text summary** screen.
- kg, kcal, 24h time, English.
- Look: being chosen — `prototypes/looks.html` (4 directions). Notifications: to talk through.

## 6. Tech

Vite + React + TypeScript · Supabase (own project, same account as Tempo) · Cloudflare. Offline
not required. Cloud storage OK. A test account for agents like Tempo's: maybe. Running cost
~€20/month is fine. Private repo `healthos`.

## 7. Status and next

**Built (29 Sept):** Today, Log (food via Open Food Facts + saved foods, drinks, stack, weight),
Workout (templates, suggested weights, rest timer), Insights (master graph + panels), Settings
(goals, caffeine/sleep, sample data, export). All logic in `src/lib`, tested. Email/password
login; data saved on the device first and synced per account. Accounts with `+test` in the
email get Dev tools (`#dev`): raw entry editor, generate/remove sample, wipe account.

1. [x] **Supabase sync** — built 29 Sept, tested two-device against a fake Supabase (12/12).
   Owner runs `supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql` once in the SQL editor.
2. [x] **Deploy** — `wrangler deploy` builds first (`wrangler.jsonc`), so Cloudflare's default
   deploy command is enough.
3. [ ] Owner sets real goals (Settings) and uses it for a few days.
4. [ ] Wearable: pick the device, then import heart rate, sleep, HRV into the master graph.
5. [ ] AI layer on top of the computed stats (weekly summary, experiment suggestions).
